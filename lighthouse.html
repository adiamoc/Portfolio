					In UC Davis, students, especially the freshmen and sophomores, are struggling with finding apartments. According to the policy, if students in the first year fail to apply for the second-year dormitory in college, they must find an apartment or house outside the school for the next year. Many students, like some of my classmates and friends, are unaware of the problem and don’t look for housing until the spring quarter, which is the last quarter of a year. They complain that they have no idea of how they can find the desired apartment online and what kind of apartment search tool they should choose. The result is that many students live in an unsatisfactory and expensive apartment for a whole year. Along with my partner, we created a website that help solving the problem for UC Davis students, which displays useful information on the map.

				<h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
				<div class="half-box">
					<img src="img/lighthouse/p1_intro.png" alt="intro model">
					<img src="img/lighthouse/p1_main.png" alt="main model">
				</div>
				<p>
					In the introduction page, instead of directly displaying the map and functions, we give a scenery of apartments. Then by clicking on the “Proceed” button, users main page, which is a map with the function bar aside.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the main page, we took lots of HCI concepts into account. Significantly, we thought about the 10 usability heuristics. First, in the map, students can see the distribution of each apartment. By clicking on the markers, they are able to see more specific information about the chosen apartment. Such design is aimed to embody the user control and freedom – they have the choice to see what they want to see and hide what they don’t want to see. Also, for the markers, we use the original Google markers according to the evaluation, recognition rather than recall. When students see the markers, they will understand that these mean apartments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, in the function bar, the functions that display different locations are in the same form for consistency. What’s more, the checkbox in each function helps students predict the operation results. Finally, at the bottom of the bar, we provide “Feedback” and “Design Process”, which show the help and documentation that assist users with the website usage.
				</p>
				<h3>Prototype/Implementation</h3>
				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/lighthouse/lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse" class="shadow">
				</div>
				<p>
					In the intro page, to outstand out design, I designed a unique logo that includes the road, position, and abbreviation of Lighthouse. By clicking on the square area, users enter the map. 
				</p>

				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/lighthouse/main.png" alt="main page" class="shadow">
				</div>
				<p>
					The main page shows the default map with the operation of clicking two markers. If users hope to see more information, we provide the website links and contact information for further housing steps. What’s more, we want to help users compare different apartments to make the best choice; therefore, the map allows multiple specific information to existing at the same time. Importantly, we hide the function bar at the left-top corner for user control and freedom.
				</p>
				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/lighthouse/filter.png" alt="tool bar" class="shadow">
				</div>
				<p>
					As for the tool bar, we show the result of searching an apartment and clicking on all the checkboxes of functions in the function bar. According to the evaluation, recognition rather than recall, the color and icon of each function are the same as they are in the real world. For example, the bus station has the same color as Unitrans. The coffee shop is a cup of coffee and brown. Beneath the functions, we provide “Help & support” and “Send feedback” for help and documentation. In addition, for error prevention, we provide the “Zoom Back” button. Once the user clicks something wrong and changes the zoom of the map by accident, he/she can easily return to the default zoom by clicking on “Zoom Back”. Also, there will be no response if the user clicks or right-clicks on the map other than the markers.
				</p>

				<h3>Discussion</h3>

				<p>
					In this project, we consider a lot about our target user – UCD students. We design every function by thinking of their benefits, show or hide any information based on their needs, and so on. We have learned how to think from the sight of a user, not a designer. Moreover, it’s important that we made our progress by creating different prototypes. The low-fidelity prototype helps us describe our concepts on the paper, and the high- fidelity one displays the result of successfully implementing the concepts.
