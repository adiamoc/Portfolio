					In thie project, we were asked to pick a typeface and create a poster that can present the characteristics of it. Before this project, our class watched Helvetica and I got attracted by the font that Bloomingdale's used that are also showed in the movie. Therefore, I picked ITC Avant Garde for the poster. During the research, I studied the background information and understand this font better. I did several versions and each of them focused on different aspects of this font. One of them is adapted from the title of Avant Garde, the magazine where the font originally came from; one of them emphasized on the numbers; one of them utilized the unique shape of "Q" of this font.

					<img src="img/avant/avant1.jpg" alt="poster 1">
					<img src="img/avant/avant2.jpg" alt="poster 2">
				</div>
				<p>
					For the final version, I chose to represent the "Q" shape in my poster. But I was not sure where to put the text box. I tried to drag the text box on the space in "Q".  But the whitespace becomes an issue. Therefore, I changed the layout of the typeface's name to balance the other things that are mostly in the left. I also tried to align the "Avant Garde" on the top, but then the connected part looks a little bit odd, so I gave up. I got the color from a 1970s poster, which was around the same time when this typeface is created.

					This is the first time I learned the importance of letterform, and it really helped me to study the basic concepts in typeface poster design. I also learned to make different use of tools in Illustrator to handle letters.
