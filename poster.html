			<h2>Poster Design</h2>

			<h3>Photoshop: Matisse / Diebenkorn</h3>
			<div class="big-box">

				<p>
					The goal of this project is to design an event poster for a leader about art or science. I decided to make a event poster for the Matisse/Diebenkorn exhibition. Matisse and Diebenkorn are both artists I really love, and I happened to have been to this exhibit. I made three versions of designs, and the final version is a combination of Matisse's and Diebenkorn's work.
				</p>

				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/moma/mask2.jpg" alt="mask design" class="shadow">
				</div>

				<p>
					I made several attempts; one of them is to use mask to show their artwork inside their names. The layout of this design is clean and simple, but the artists’ artworks are "hidden" behind and viewers' focus might get lost. This is definitely not what I want to the viewer to feel. Beside using masks, I also tried to use both their portrait works and combine them since this is a joint exhibit. It looks really nice, but it is not so eye-catching.
				</p>
				<div class="quarter-box">
					<img src="img/moma/half1.jpg" alt="half desing 1">
					<img src="img/moma/half2.jpg" alt="half desing 2">
					<img src="img/moma/half3.jpg" alt="half desing 3">
					<img src="img/moma/half4.jpg" alt="half desing 4">
				</div>

				<p>
					The final design used Diebenkorn's Ocean Park #27 to mask La femme au chapeau by Matisse, and left some parts of Diebenkorn's painting unchanged. There're some minor issues — printing problem, low resolution, alignment on the top, and pixelated logo. So I searched again and changed both artworks to the highest resolution images I can find. And I moved "M" up a little bit to avoid the annoying white space on the top. As The logo used a font specially created for SFMOMA, a modification of Futura, I retraced it, and it turned out to be much better. I think the hardest part is not Photoshop, but is to create a poster that can catch a reader's attention. The intention of the poster, the effectiveness of the poster is what I need to consider.

			<h3>Illustrator: Avant Garde</h3>

			<div class="big-box">
				<img src="img/avant/avant.jpg" alt="avant garde" class="shadow">
			</div>

			<div class="write">
				<p>
					In thie project, we were asked to pick a typeface and create a poster that can present the characteristics of it. I picked ITC Avant Garde for the poster. During the research, I studied the background information and understand this font better. I did several versions and each of them focused on different aspects of this font. One of them is adapted from the title of Avant Garde, the magazine where the font originally came from; one of them emphasized on the numbers; one of them utilized the unique shape of "Q" of this font.
				</p>
				<div class="half-box">
					<img src="img/avant/avant1.jpg" alt="poster 1">
					<img src="img/avant/avant2.jpg" alt="poster 2">
				</div>
				<p>
					For the final version, I chose to represent the "Q" shape in my poster. But I was not sure where to put the text box. I tried to drag the text box on the space in "Q".  But the whitespace becomes an issue. Therefore, I changed the layout of the typeface's name to balance the other things that are mostly in the left. I use a color palette from a 1970s poster, which was around the same time when this typeface is created to indicate the historical background.

			<h3>Silk Screen Printing: Kingfisher</h3>

			<div class="big-box">
				<img src="img/silk/bird.jpg" alt="kingfisher" class="shadow">
			</div>

			<div class="write">
				<p>
					I choose animal protection as my poster topic, with a focus on the protection of kingfisher; kingfisher is a type of bird under Coraciiformes, an order that has many color birds. The reason why I want to focus on this topic is because an incident about kingfisher. An online shopping company in China started crowdfunding on jewelry that used a traditional method called Tian-tsui (dotting with kingfishers), and wrote on the description that they all used really kingfisher feather in their making process. But it is rather hard to get kingfisher’s feather as they can not be artificial cultured; in order to gather a large amount of feather, the only way to do this is to haunt kingfishers in the the wild and kill them to get their feather.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was a rather ancient way to make jewel that has the color of kingfisher’s feather when there were no other way and people don’t know about animal protection. But now, there’re new technology that can achieve the same effect without using real kingfisher’s feather, so there is no need to use the real feather. But some people still want to purchase jewelry that are made out of kingfisher’s feather and this should be stopped. I have always been an animal lover and I believe such behavior should come to an end. Although Tian-tusi is very beautiful and is a traditional way of crafting, we should only leave this method in the history. I believe that by making a poster on this topic can help people learn about the cruelty of Tian-tusi, and stop the old craft method by boycotting the jewelry made with kingfisher’s life. I want to distribute this poster on piazza and online as the main purpose is to have people know that they can save kingfisher’s life by not buying product that uses Tian-tsui.

			<h3>Silk Screen Printing: Vaccine</h3>

			<div class="big-box">
				<img src="img/silk/fake.jpg" alt="vaccine" class="shadow">
			</div>
			<div class="write">
				<p>
					For this poster I focused on the recent vaccine scandal in China. In 2018, 11th July, an employee in Chanchun Changsheng Biotechnology reported that the vaccines manufactured by the company is faulty. Then China’s Food and Drug Administration launched their investigation and revoked their license of the production of human rabies and Changsheng recalled all unused rabies vaccines. This incident came to people’s attention after serval days’ news reporting and the attention from we media; what Changsheng did now raise people’s rage and five senior executives of the company was took by the Chanchun police for questioning. After people learn about this company, it shows that this has been happening for a very long time and rabies is not the only type of vaccine that is faulty.any defective vaccines have already reached the market and given to some Chinese children. Though some of it has been recalled, where the rest vaccines go are still under the investigation and for those children that already took the vaccine, how it will affect their health is still unknown. In a statement, a total of 253,338 vaccines were found to be faulty, which was sold to Shandong Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center.
				</p>
				<p>
					Children as our next generation should be protected and I don’t want this incident to be forgotten after a few months. I hope that by creating a poster on this vaccine scandal, more people can learn about this incident and keep following up the incident. And I hope that the government can keep up their investigation and prevent similar things from happening again.
