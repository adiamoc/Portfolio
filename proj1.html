					In 2017, UC Davis was selected as one of the six design unversities to design the installation for SOFA Chicago's annual student design competition -- <a href="http://www.sofaexpo.com/2017-connect">CONNECT</a> and I was in charge of the projection for the installation.

					My original design wants to simulate the feeling of underground water level dropping; so I decide to use blue lines that are generated from the sides to the middle to create approach my design. After discussing with my partner, we change the lines to dots to better represent our idea. We also tried several different approaches to have a better representation of our idea, like adding a background, changing the color, but still we thinking the projection does not match perfectly with the installation's idea.

					After discussing with the group, we decided to use the actual topological rings of the delta area to be our main look. We took the idea generated from the first design -- the ground is sinking -- and put this concept into the new design. We used <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> as the tool for generating the animation. The topological rings grow and fades with time, indicating the sinking of the ground.

					This is a really interesting and useful experience for me. It taught me a lot: how to work in a team, how to adjust the content according to the requirements, how finish everything with a limited time. I have met a lot of difficulties, but I successfully overcame all of them and I'm proud to see what we have accomplished.
