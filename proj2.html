					The goal of this project is to design an event poster for a leader about art or science. I decided to make a event poster for the Matisse/Diebenkorn exhibition. Matisse and Diebenkorn are both artists I really love, and I happened to have been to this exhibit. I made three kinds of designs at first, the final version is a combination of Matisse's and Diebenkorn's work.

					I made several attempts; one of them is to use mask to show their artwork inside their names. The layout of this design is clean and simple, but the artists’ artworks are "hidden" behind and viewers' focus might get lost. This is definitely not what I want to the viewer to feel. Beside using masks, I also tried to use both their portrait works and combine them since this is a joint exhibit. It looks really nice, but it is not so eye-catching.

				<p>
					The final design used Diebenkorn's Ocean Park #27 to mask La femme au chapeau by Matisse, and left some parts of Diebenkorn's painting unchanged. There're some minor issues — printing problem, low resolution, alignment on the top, and pixelated logo. So I searched again and changed both artworks to the highest resolution images I can find. And I moved "M" up a little bit to avoid the annoying white space on the top. As The logo used a font specially created for SFMOMA, a modification of Futura, I retraced it, and it turned out to be much better.

					I think the hardest part is not Photoshop, but is to create a poster that can catch a reader's attention. The intention of the poster, the effectiveness of the poster is what I need to consider.
