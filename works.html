							This is a mirroring paper cut work, using only one black sheets of paper to make use of the white space, showing balance and continuity. One of the challenges of this work is that some parts of the cutting is really thin and fragile, so I need to pay extra attention to the force I applies to the cutting knife.

							Also only using one sheet of black paper, this work puts more emphasis on breaking the frame. The hardest part of this piece is to decide a balanced layout for different pieces. I made several attempts to change the layout, and at last I decided to place the birds to the lower right corner to balance the large black space on the top left corner.

							The main focus of this work is to explore the different transparency of different materials -- zero transparency, half transparency, and full transparency. The inspiration of this design comes from the half transparency paper; it creates a smoky atmosphere around it. The hardest part was to draw on the transparent paper, as it is too smooth to hold any ink on it, so I choose to use paper cutting to finish my design.

							In this work, we were asked to use at least three different shades of gray to finish the work. There were one gray paper and one black paper provided. So for the rest kinds of gray, we need to choose between pencil and oil paint. As I really want to keep a clear and simple look of my design, I decided to use pencil and I only drew the outline of her face. In this way, although less content is conveyed from the work, there're more space for the viewer's imagination.
