					For this project, I want to create a website that can create pixel art for designers, even for non designers who are interested in creating pixel arts. Also, I hope it could show some of the artwork that other people made. The reason that I want to choose pixel art is that it is widely used in all art related industry and it is easy for people who do not have a rich art background to get started in art. I first had this idea when my friend, a game design major student, told me that she had difficulty creating artwork for her game since she does not have any artists in her group. And she told me that she can create some simple artwork by herself, and pixel art can be a great option. So I made a website that can help solving this problem: <a href="https://adiamoc.github.io/des157-g/process/development/final/index.html">Pixir</a>.

				<h3>Persona</h3>
				<div class="big-box">

					My primary audience is my classmates and teachers. They all know about design and art and know how to create artworks of their own. My secondary audience is everyone who are interested in making pixel art. They might not have too much art background. I want to focus on how art can help people in different aspects of life and how it can benefit people without art background. I want the tool to be accessible to everyone.

				<h3>Compositions</h3>
				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/pixir/comps1.jpg" alt="composition 1" class="shadow">
				</div>
				<div class="big-box">
					<img src="img/pixir/comps2.jpg" alt="composition 2" class="shadow">
				</div>
				<p>
					I want my website to be simple and clear, using minimal design and a clean color scheme. By limiting the options, users can focus more on how their artwork is created without being distracted by other things. I made two different compositions for the UI design; after further consideration, I decide to use the second composition for the final development.
