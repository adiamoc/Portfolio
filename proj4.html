					In this project, I did a drawing of a costume design; the idea originates from flower. "Natural", "Monochromatic", "Analogous" and "Complementary" are the four color schemes I used for this project.

					Before I start to draw in Illustrator, I first worked on the paper sketch. Then I traced my work using the pen tool and the pencil tool in Illustrator. At first, I did not know anything about closed path, and the layers are completely messed up. After seeing the demonstration in class, I redo the tracing and it came out to be much better. This time I was able to group all the paths together to do the next step â€” filling the color. I used Adobe Color CC to pick the colors and used live paint bucket to fill them. I also learned how to use swatches to save my color scheme and how to set base color to get all the different tints and shades of it.

					Through the critique and the feedback from my classmates and teachers, I realized that there're many things I could do to improve my work. I added faces to all of them. I also resized the square in the background and cut off some parts of the right foot to make the figure look like flying out. Besides, I made some changes to the color in different parts of the illustration and recolored the analogous.
